```

#### Feature Requests
For feature requests, please include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed implementation approach (if any)
- Potential impact on existing functionality

### Contributing Code

#### Workflow
1. **Create an Issue**: Discuss your proposed changes first
2. **Fork & Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Develop**: Implement your changes following our guidelines
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests
5. **Document**: Update documentation as needed
6. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with clear description

#### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-component-search`
- `bugfix/fix-embedding-generation`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/improve-vector-db-performance`

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add component search endpoint

Add new endpoint for searching electronic components
with semantic similarity and filtering capabilities.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(vector-db): resolve memory leak in batch operations

Fixed issue where ChromaDB connections weren't properly
closed after batch operations, causing memory usage to
grow over time.

Fixes #456
```

### Code Standards

#### Python Style Guide
We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

#### Code Formatting
We use automated formatting tools:
```bash
# Format code
black backend/src
isort backend/src

# Check formatting
black backend/src --check
isort backend/src --check-only
```

#### Type Checking
All code should pass type checking:
```bash
mypy backend/src
```

#### Linting
Code should pass linting checks:
```bash
flake8 backend/src
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Coverage
- All new code must have tests
- Maintain minimum 90% test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests

#### Test Types Required
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
3. **API Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints
4. **Performance Tests**: For performance-critical code

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend/src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m "not performance"  # Skip slow tests
pytest -m integration        # Run integration tests only
```

### Documentation

#### Required Documentation
- **API Changes**: Update API documentation
- **New Features**: Add usage examples
- **Configuration**: Document new settings
- **Breaking Changes**: Update migration guide

#### Documentation Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
