### Test Issues
- **Performance Test Failures**: 2 tests failing due to performance thresholds
- **Windows File Locking**: 5 errors related to temporary file cleanup on Windows
- **Overall Health**: 98.7% test success rate (147/149 meaningful tests passing)

## 🎯 Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Fix Windows-specific file permission issues in tests
- [ ] Optimize embedding generation performance
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer for improved performance
- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization

### Short Term (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Frontend development (React/Vue.js)
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket notifications
- [ ] Advanced search filters and sorting
- [ ] Component recommendation engine improvements
- [ ] Batch processing optimizations

### Medium Term (3-6 Months)

## 🔍 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Performance Tests**: Some tests exceed performance thresholds on slower machines
2. **Windows Compatibility**: File locking issues during test cleanup
3. **Memory Usage**: Embedding model loading causes initial memory spike

### Workarounds
- Performance tests can be skipped with `pytest -m "not performance"`
- Windows users can run tests with `--no-cov` flag to avoid cleanup issues
- Memory usage stabilizes after initial model loading
